This topic takes you through the steps to set up your first Dyte interactive livestream (ILS).

## Step 1: Create a Dyte Developer Account

Login to the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/) and create an account.

## Step 2: Create Presets

A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to hosts and participants. They determine the look, feel, and behavior of the livestream, with options to set varied permissions, such as the ability to create polls or chat, control access for plugins, and more.

:::info Note
You need to create two presets for livestreaming. One preset is used for the livestreaming host and the other preset is used for the livestreaming viewer.

The host requires certain host controls such as the ability to Kick Participants, Mute Audio, Mute Video, and Pin Participant, as well as media permissions like Start Livestream and Admit or remove participants from the livestream. Ensure that you’ve selected those permissions for the host.
:::

1. In the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/), click **Presets**, and click **Create New**.

     className="livestrem-create-preset"
   />
2. In the **Select Meeting Type**, select **Livestream**.
3. Set permissions and UI configurations for your livestream.

### Configuration

You can define the following permissions and UI configurations:

**Max number of people on screen**: Set the maximum number of participants who can appear on the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 6 and 9 for the best possible experience.

**Max number of people screensharing**: Set the maximum number of participants who can share the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 3 to 4 for the best experience.

#### Host Controls

Host controls allow you as the host to control various aspects of a Dyte livestream, such as managing the participants.

## Step 4: Create a Meeting

Create a Dyte meeting using the [Create Meeting API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/create_meeting). This API returns a unique identifier for your meeting.

If you wish to start livestreaming the meeting as soon as it starts, set the `live_stream_on_start` parameter `true`.

## Step 5: Add Participants

After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/add_participant).

The `presetName` created earlier must be passed in the body of the Add Participant API request.

## Step 6: Start Livestreaming

Use the [Start livestreaming a meeting](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/paths/meetings-meeting_id--livestreams/post) API or click on the **Go live** button on the control bar to start livestreaming a meeting.

If you’re a host you’ll see the option to **Go live** and **End live** streaming.

**Start live streaming**
