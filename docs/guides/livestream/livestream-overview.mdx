# Interactive Livestreaming Overview

:::info Beta
The new Interactive Live Streaming (ILS) feature is currently in beta, which means it is still being tested and evaluated, and may undergo some change. Please [contact us](https://dyte.io/contact) if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements to the feature.
:::

Interactive livestreaming (ILS) is the broadcast of video and audio content over the internet,
usually through a web viewer or an application. Live streaming sends RTMP
streams, or real-time data such as video and audio from call participants, over
the internet to viewers. This can be used to broadcast events such as webinars,
hackathons, conferences, online classes, concerts, all-hands meetings, and even
your own metaverse party.

  [OBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio),
  [ffmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg), and others. To put it simply,
  you can livestream any RTMP input from any source using Dyte.
- Allows you to broadcast a multi-participant video call in real time that

  or LinkedIn.

  one-to-many stream to a highly interactive live event.

  video workflow without any additional servers or infrastructure. Youâ€™ll have
  access to better quality streams with low latency and wide device support.

  as YouTube, Twitch, LinkedIn, and more.

## Dyte's ILS Features

Dyte's Interactive Live Streaming (ILS) feature is designed around the concept of a **stage** that is accessible to both hosts and viewers. Hosts have direct access to the stage, while viewers can request to join it. The stage is broadcasted live to all viewers.

With Dyte's ILS, you can:

- Broadcast a meeting to up to 100,000 viewers with low latency of just 3 to 6 seconds.
- Chat with participants during the live stream.
- Create and share polls with participants.
- Allow viewers to raise their hand, and the host can invite them to join the stage.
- Host can directly invite viewers to join the stage.
