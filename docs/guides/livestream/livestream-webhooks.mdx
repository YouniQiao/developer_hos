You can use [webhooks](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/webhooks/webhooks-overview) to notify your application when the status of a livestream changes, such as when it is live or offline.

## Configure a webhook

As a first step, you'll have to set up a webhook to receive real-time updates for your livestream.

For the detailed steps on how to set up a webhook, see [Set Up Webhooks ](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/webhooks/webhooks-and-events).

## Listen for the livestreaming event

You can listen to the `livestreaming.statusUpdate` event.

This event is triggered when a livestream's status changes. Possible values for status are `LIVE` and `OFFLINE`.
