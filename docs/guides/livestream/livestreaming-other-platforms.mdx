# Livestream Dyte Meetings to Other Platforms

Dyte can livestream your meeting live to any platform that supports an RTMP
endpoint, such as YouTube or Twitch. Simply provide the RTMP input URL where you want the meeting video to be streamed when you start recording the meeting, for example, `rtmp://your.rtmp.url/live/stream/your-stream-key`.

For example, if you want to stream it to [restream.io](https://restream.io), do
the following:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY yourapi-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "liveStreamingConfig": {
        "rtmpUrl": "rtmp://live.restream.io/live/your-stream-key"
    }
}'
```

### Considerations

1. Currently, you need to
   [start a recording](/api/?v=v1#/operations/start_recording) to livestream
   your content.
2. There is few seconds of lag between the meeting and the stream.
